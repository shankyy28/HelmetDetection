def count_helmets(bikes, helmets_in, expanding_factor = 0.30):
    """
    Count the number of bikes with and without helmets based on their bounding boxes.

    This function attempts to pair each bike with a helmet by checking if a helmet's
    bounding box is within an expanded area above the bike's bounding box. The expanded
    area is determined by the bike's dimensions and the expanding_factor.

    Parameters:
    -----------
    bikes : list of tuple
        A list of bike bounding boxes. Each box is represented as a tuple of four 
        values (x1, y1, x2, y2), where (x1, y1) is the top-left corner and (x2, y2) 
        is the bottom-right corner of the bounding box.

    helmets_in : list of tuple
        A list of helmet bounding boxes, in the same format as the bikes list.

    expanding_factor : float, optional (default=0.30)
        A factor to expand the search area for helmets around each bike. This allows
        for some flexibility in the relative positioning of helmets to bikes.

    Returns:
    --------
    tuple of int
        A tuple containing two values:
        - count_helmet: The number of bikes with a detected helmet.
        - count_no_helmet: The number of bikes without a detected helmet.

    Notes:
    ------
    - The function modifies a copy of the helmets_in list, removing helmets as they
      are matched to bikes to prevent double-counting.
    - A helmet is considered matched to a bike if it's within the expanded area above
      the bike, which is defined as:
      * Horizontally: within the bike's width, expanded by expanding_factor.
      * Vertically: from slightly below the top of the bike to one bike height above,
        with both limits expanded by expanding_factor.
    - The function stops searching for a helmet once it finds a match for a bike.
    - Bounding box coordinates are adjusted to ensure x1 < x2 and y1 < y2.

    Example:
    --------
    >>> bikes = [(100, 100, 200, 200), (300, 300, 400, 400)]
    >>> helmets = [(120, 50, 180, 90), (320, 250, 380, 290)]
    >>> count_helmet(bikes, helmets)
    (2, 0)

    # essentially, if a helmet is found in an area that is the same as the bike_box, but on top of it, then we do + helmet count. 
    # else + no_helmet count
    # no need to think about "the closest helmet", as there is no metric on which we can decide a helmet to be "closer" in this method of consideration.
    # A helmet is either in the zone and then thus accounted for and deleted, or it is not in the zone and skipped.
    # And to consider the cases in which helmets may be "partially" in the area, the "allowable" area has been made flexible by an input "expanding_factor"
